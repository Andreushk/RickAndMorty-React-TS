# RickAndMorty-React-TS

## About:

This is a test assignment for IT Bootcamp at the summer 2023. But now I decided to renovate my solution with using of TypeScript and try playing around with Ky for requests (lightweight library) and Vite for builds. So it is a simple React/TypeScript application that allows to view information about all characters from the «Rick and Morty» series.

## Stack:

- React
- Ky
- TypeScript
- StyledComponents
- Vite

## API:

The Rick and Morty API: [https://rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

## Deploy:

This application is available for viewing on Vercel: [https://rick-and-morty-react-ts.vercel.app](https://rick-and-morty-react-ts.vercel.app/).

## More:

I also have a pure JavaScript implementation here: https://github.com/Andreushk/RickAndMorty-JavaScript.
