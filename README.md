# RickAndMorty-React-TS

## About
This was a test task for the IT Bootcamp. But, now, I decided to update my solution and once again practice my skills with TypeScript and Redux. 
So, this is a simple React/TypeScript application that allows you to view information about all the characters from the movie "Rick and Morty". 

## Stack
- React
- Redux
- TypeScript
- StyledComponents
- Vite

## API:
The Rick and Morty API: [https://rickandmortyapi.com](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

## More
I also have a pure JavaScript implementation here: https://github.com/Andreushk/RickAndMorty-JavaScript.
